TCP IP- Udemy

Protocols
IP -Internet Protocol
TCP- Transmissions Control Protocol
UDP- User Datagram Protocol
ARP-Address Resolution Protocol

SMTP – Simple Mail Transfer Protocol
http- Hypertext Transport Protocol
POP- Post Office Protocol

Utilities

Wireshark – Capturing packets
Ping- Network diagnostics
Netstat – Network diagnostics

http Request>TCP>IP>Ethernet----→ Network Device---→ISP

Ping uses ICMP -> IP
====================================================

OSI Model

*Open Systems Interconnection
*Seven Layer Model
*Adopted by the ISO as standard communication architecture
 
*Protocol Agnostic- Not tied to any specific protocol.

	Layer 1- Physical
•	Handles all physical connections- (coax, 4-pair, fiber)
•	Handles Error Correction and detection on the physical medium

	Layer 2- Data Link
•	Handles translation from digital data to physical signals (framing)
•	Physical Addressing (Media Access Control)
•	Flow Control & access control (CSMA/CD Carrier Sense Multiple Access collision Detection) 
  Random backoff timers to prevent collisions. Different Protocols use different ways 
  –ex.  Appletalk uses Collision avoidance rather than detection

	Layer 3 - Network
•	Logical Addressing
•	Handles getting data from one network to another (and repackaging data to work with the other side) 
•	Contrast with Data Link layer which is within the same network
	
	Layer 4 – Transport
•	handles end-to-end reliable data service
•	IN the case of TCP/IP, handles ports to differentiate traffic
	
	Layer 5 – Session
•	Controls specific dialogs between two systems (session management)
•	Sometimes disagreement over which protocols land here (SSL/TLS, SSH, NetBios etc.)

	Layer 6 – Presentation
•	Manages how data is presented (xml, jpeg)

	Layer 7 – Application  (http, ftp, smtp)
•	Applications
•	Closest to User
•	Must do all management of connections
•	Web access, email, file transfer

Each layer speaks to another layer, adding a header (encapsulation), and each layer is responsible for peeling those 
headers off at the other end. Each layer handles the same data on the sending or receiving end.
